# Beginner's Series: Vue.js

This is the supporting repository for the Beginner's Series: Vue.js videos. You will find all the sample code used during the videos, as well as links to additional information and resources.

## Vue.js

Vue.js (also called Vue) was created by Evan You and first released in February 2014. His objective for Vue was to create a progressive, lightweight version of JavaScript.

Vue was designed to allow developers to create a user interface by adding a set of custom HTML attributes that connect software components with data. To accomplish this task, Vue.js interprets the HTML attributes as directives that bind input or output parts of the page to a model. The model is represented by standard JavaScript variables.

You can add the Vue core library to any page and immediately start creating dynamic HTML markup that uses powerful features for data binding and event handling, and grow to full modularized applications based around Vue.js using single file components.
