# Vue CLI and single-file components

Although it's possible to create an entire Vue.js application in a single JavaScript file, it will become unmanageable in all but the smallest applications. To support breaking your application into smaller units, Vue allows you to create components. Components are reusable building blocks from which you can create your application.

Components can be created as JavaScript files, or through a single-file component with a .vue extension. Single-file components use a specialized syntax that browsers can't read. This syntax must be converted into the appropriate JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The process of converting specialized syntax into something a browser can read is called bundling, and it requires extra tooling such as webpack.

Fortunately, Vue also provides a command-line interface (CLI) that you can use to bootstrap an application. The CLI configures all of the necessary tooling, including a bundler and a development server.
