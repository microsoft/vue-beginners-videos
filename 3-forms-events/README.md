# Forms, data and events

Users typically modify data in a web application by using a form. Because Vue.js is about working with dynamic data, it has a robust mechanism for binding data to forms. You can also manage events, performing different operations when a user selects a button or otherwise interacts with the page. And you can even add values that are computed dynamically, allowing you to minimize the amount of repeated code.
